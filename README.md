## Troubleshooting
- **Connection Problems**: Ensure you have a stable internet connection. If you encounter connection issues, the script will notify you and attempt to reconnect.
- **Comment Failure**: If the script fails to comment, the post might not be commentable, the post ID might be unavailable, or your Facebook account could be blocked.
- **Invalid Cookies**: If you receive an error related to cookies, ensure your cookies are correctly saved in `Penyimpanan/Cookie.json`. Re-run the login process if necessary.
- **Script Stuck**: If the script gets stuck, you can stop it using `CTRL + C` and restart it.
- **Login Issues**: If you fail to log in, ensure that your Facebook account language is set to Indonesian and that you are not using the free mode on your account.
- **Image Generation Failure**: If the script fails to create images, there might be an issue with the AI server.

## Warning
Users should exercise caution and avoid setting the delay too short, as this may result in your account being blocked. Always enable two-factor authentication for added security, and ensure your email and phone number are updated and verified.
